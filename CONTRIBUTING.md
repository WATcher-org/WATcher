
# How  Watcher works ?

First let's understand how it works.

`./install` file install's all the py scripts and make Watcher to run on startup.


--------------------------- ## **v1.0** ## ----------------------------

- **[afk.py](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/blob/v1.0/src/Watcher/afk.py)** : As name sugested it records the time for being afk it will count afk time when no input is given within 1 min . Also it ignores if their is video playback.

- **[analysis.py](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/blob/v1.0/src/Watcher/analysis.py)** : It gives the report  for the week summary and day summary of the usage.
- **[commands.py](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/blob/v1.0/src/Watcher/commands.py)** : This is used to display the data that analysis.py has analysed. Additionally, it contains all of the command outputs; in essence, this file is where the user interacts with the Wacther.

- **[get_windows.py](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/blob/v1.0/src/Watcher/get_windows.py)** : It gives the title/name of the Active Window/App.

- **[time_operations.py](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/blob/v1.0/src/Watcher/time_operations.py)** : It converts the raw time data into time how much the app is used. Also format produce the time in [HH:MM:SS](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E41183_01/DR/Time_Formats.html) format.

- **[watch.log](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/blob/v1.0/src/Watcher/watch_log.py)** : This is where the logs file are created it creates two kind of log files for Week analysis and Day analysis, log files for Day analysis are created in [Date].csv format and for week W[week_no.]_[year].py format.

----------------------------- ## **v2.0** ## --------------------------

#### Main Difference between [v1.0](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/tree/v1.0/src/Watcher) and [v2.0](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/tree/v2.0/src/Watcher) is the Represntation of the csv and the Algorithm( The way in which it calculate and present the usage time ) is **optimized**.

- #### The file which is changed mainly is [analysis.py](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/blob/v2.0/src/Watcher/analysis.py) and the [watch_log.py](https://github.com/Waishnav/Watcher/blob/v2.0/src/Watcher/watch_log.py).

#### In v1.0 their is multiple session of time created even for the same window/apps but in v2.0 this is optimized and been removed the multiple session for each apps.
